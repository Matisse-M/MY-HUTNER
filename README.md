Just a little description of this "game"

Click on the .exe file "my_hunter" to start the game. You just arrive on the game menu
where you can click on the start button to go on the game screen. Pidgey appear on the 
2 sides of your screen and you must click on them before they leave your screen. Pidgey
are random reset so you can't know where they will spawn.
